3. **Complete Auth Flow**: Implement registration screen in mobile app
4. **Opportunity Details**: Create detail views for opportunities

### Feature Implementation
1. **Search & Filtering**: Implement Meilisearch integration
2. **QR Code Scanning**: Implement event check-in feature
3. **Skills Matching**: AI-powered skills extraction from resumes
4. **Push Notifications**: Set up Expo push notifications
5. **Location Services**: Implement location-based opportunity discovery

### Backend Enhancements
1. **Email Verification**: Complete email verification flow
2. **Background Checks**: Integrate with background check service
3. **File Uploads**: Configure S3 for resume and image storage
4. **WebSocket Support**: Real-time notifications and chat

## üìù Development Notes

### API Authentication
- JWT tokens are used for stateless authentication
- Tokens are stored in localStorage (web) and SecureStore (mobile)
- Token refresh mechanism needs to be implemented

### Database Schema
- All models are created and ready for migration
- PostGIS extension needed for geolocation features
- Background jobs will use Celery (to be added)

### Testing
- Unit tests need to be written for all API endpoints
- Frontend component tests using React Testing Library
- Mobile tests using Jest and Expo testing tools

## üéØ Project Goals Alignment

The implementation follows the MishMob vision of connecting volunteers with meaningful opportunities through:
- **Skills-Based Matching**: Database structure supports skill tracking and matching
- **Community Building**: Social features ready to implement
- **Impact Tracking**: Models in place for tracking volunteer hours and impact
- **Mobile-First**: Native mobile app for on-the-go volunteering

## üöÄ Ready to Launch

The basic infrastructure is complete and ready for:
1. Running the development environment
2. Creating test data
3. Implementing remaining features
4. User testing and feedback

Run `docker-compose up` to start developing!
