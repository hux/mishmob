| `intermediate` | 💪 | Can Do | Comfortable with fundamentals |
| `advanced` | ⭐ | Strong | Experienced and proficient |
| `expert` | 🏆 | Expert | Master level, can teach others |

## Design Patterns

### Progress Indicators
- **Top Bar**: Linear progress bar (0-100%)
- **Step Dots**: Visual indicators showing current/completed steps
- **Time Counter**: Real-time countdown of estimated seconds remaining
- **Skills Badge**: Running count of skills added

### Animations
- **Page Transitions**: Slide in/out with fade (300ms)
- **Card Selection**: Scale up on hover (1.05x), pulse on active
- **Success States**: Spring animation with confetti/party emoji
- **Progress Bar**: Smooth transitions with easing

### Color Coding
- **Primary Blue**: Main actions and progress
- **Secondary Orange**: Highlights and accents
- **Green**: Success states, completed items
- **Yellow/Orange**: Learning/beginner level
- **Blue**: Intermediate level
- **Purple**: Advanced level
- **Orange/Gold**: Expert level

## Usage

### Starting the Assessment

Users can access the wizard at `/skills-assessment` (protected route, requires authentication).

**Typical entry points:**
1. First-time user onboarding
2. Profile completion prompt
3. "Improve your matches" CTA on dashboard
4. Registration flow redirect

### Skipping & Navigation

- **Back Button**: Available on all steps except first
- **Skip to Review**: Link at bottom of each step
- **Continue Button**: Advances to next step
- **Complete Profile**: Final button submits all skills

### Data Persistence

- Skills are stored in `wizardData` state
- Batch submission on completion
- All skills saved atomically to prevent partial updates
- Redirects to dashboard on success

## Integration Points

### 1. **Onboarding Flow**
Add after registration for new volunteers:
```tsx
// In Register.tsx after successful registration
navigate('/skills-assessment?source=onboarding');
```

### 2. **Dashboard CTA**
Prompt users with few skills:
```tsx
{userSkills.length < 5 && (
  <Banner>
    <Link to="/skills-assessment">
      Complete your profile to get better matches
    </Link>
  </Banner>
)}
```

### 3. **Opportunity Matching**
Enhanced matching with proficiency levels:
```python
# In opportunities.py
def calculate_skill_match(opportunity, user_skills):
    # Weight by proficiency level
    weights = {'beginner': 0.5, 'intermediate': 0.75, 'advanced': 1.0, 'expert': 1.25}
```

## Future Enhancements

### Short Term
- [ ] Save progress in localStorage for interruptions
- [ ] Add "why we're asking" tooltips
- [ ] Show skill popularity indicators
- [ ] Add visual skill cloud on review

### Medium Term
- [ ] Resume/LinkedIn import integration
- [ ] Skill verification flow
- [ ] Peer endorsements
- [ ] Achievement badges for completing assessment

### Long Term
- [ ] AI-powered skill inference from descriptions
- [ ] Video skill demonstrations

- [ ] Annual skill refresh reminders

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Complete full flow in < 2 minutes
- [ ] Test on mobile (responsive design)
- [ ] Verify API error handling
- [ ] Test with no internet (offline state)
- [ ] Check accessibility (keyboard navigation)
- [ ] Verify animations on slower devices
- [ ] Test with existing skills (edit mode)
- [ ] Validate proficiency level updates
- [ ] Check batch skill submission
- [ ] Verify redirect after completion

## Analytics Events to Track

- `assessment_started` - User enters wizard
- `assessment_step_completed` - Each step completion with duration
- `assessment_abandoned` - User exits before completing
- `assessment_completed` - Full completion with skill count
- `skill_added` - Individual skill additions
- `skill_removed` - Individual skill removals
- `proficiency_updated` - Proficiency level changes
- `assessment_source` - Entry point (onboarding, dashboard, etc.)

## Performance Considerations

- **API Calls**: Minimize by batching skill additions
- **Animations**: Use transform/opacity for better performance
- **Images**: All icons are emoji (no image loading)
- **State**: Single component state tree, no context drilling
- **Debouncing**: Search input debounced at 300ms
- **Lazy Loading**: Each step component loads on demand

## Accessibility

- **Keyboard Navigation**: Full keyboard support
- **Screen Readers**: ARIA labels on all interactive elements
- **Focus Management**: Proper focus trap in modal states
- **Color Contrast**: WCAG AA compliant
- **Touch Targets**: Minimum 44x44px tap areas
- **Error States**: Clear error messages and recovery paths
